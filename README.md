Oscilloscope View
=================

A simple application demonstrating the use of a custom Oscilloscope view.

Shows two different views with different points and speeds. A small erase bar is also used to mimic the behaviour of a vital signs monitor. This code isn't packaged very well, but it's all in one file and pretty short and I hope it helps someone else out because I tried using [android-plot](https://bitbucket.org/androidplot/androidplot) to mimic a patient signs machine, but found it wasn't performant enough for my needs (60fps).
